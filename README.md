# QUICHE

QUantitative InterCellular nicHe Enrichment

## Introduction

QUICHE is a statistical differential abundance testing method that can be used to discover spatial niches enriched in specific covariates, such as cell populations, larger histologic structural regions, or patient groups. In contrast to existing approaches, QUICHE uses graph neighborhoods to detect differentially enriched spatial niches that are statistically-associated with any of these covariates, even when their prevalence is low. For more details on the method, please read the associated preprint: [Ranek JS, Greenwald NF, Goldston M, Camacho Fullaway C, Mouron S, Quintela-Fandino M, Angelo M.
